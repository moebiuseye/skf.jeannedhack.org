title:Code released
author:moebius_eye

I have released the first version of Statikiss Framework. For now, it has 
four plugins. All of which need some testing, so feel free to play around 
with it and report any issues. 

You can find the code on [github](https://github.com/moebiuseye/skf). 

I will be writing a bit of plugin develloper documentation, so if you are 
interested, take a look at the files and tell me if something is unclear.
