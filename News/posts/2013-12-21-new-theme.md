title:New theme: redish

I released the first additional theme for skf. 
It's pretty close to the default one, except it's not neutral and boring. 

You should be able to see how it looks like by visiting [this link][www]. 

I might just rewrite the default theme since I realized it might be a 
turnoff for people who would have otherwise tried it out. 
Anyway, on another note: 
skf is getting better and better. I think we can safely say it's useable 
and not too buggy.
