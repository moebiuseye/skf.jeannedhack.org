##This is StatiKiss Framework.
###It is inspired on Suckless Web Framework

The aim of this program is to provide a way to generate a website 
which is _hopefully_ optimal in terms of performance, security, and features. 

Statikiss Framework is heavily inspired on [Suckless Web Framework][SWF], 
which is a great project. They made something suckless and stopped before 
it turned sour. :)

This here project is different in a number of ways. 

* It is made so that you can create plugins very easily. 
* It's configurable, although not configuring it is not a catastrophy. 
* You can make complicated stuff, if you are missing the point 
of the [KISS principle][KISS]. 
* You can make sub-folders have a completely different layout and 
style. 

Yet, it is very similar in the following points. 

* You write stuff with markdown. 
* Every subfolder in your website gives you a link to the "subcategory". 
* You can Keep It Simple, Stupid.
