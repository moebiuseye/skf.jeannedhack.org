This plugin simply copies the content of the source directory. 

This plugin was never thoroughly tested. 

you should set the plugin variable, like so

    export plugin="just_copy"


Like any other plugin, it <b>does not prevent discovery of sub-folders</b>, 
and the sub-folders containing a .skfrc file will not be copied.
